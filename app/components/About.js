I am a senior software Developer with more than five years of
experience in full-stack web development. I use cutting-edge
technologies such as Python, React, Node.js, REST API, MySQL,
MongoDB, Java, Java EE, Spring Boot, GraphQL, and Material UI to
create Full Stack Web Applications that support the scientific and
engineering projects of ONERA and its partners.
In addition to my web development skills, I have a strong
background in computational fluid dynamics, combustion modeling,
and chemical kinetics, which I apply to implement and optimize
numerical methods and algorithms in Python. I have also published
several papers in peer-reviewed journals and presented my
research at international conferences. I am passionate about
solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions that
advance the field of aerospace research.
